<h2>Client Report</h2>

<p>For my page I choose photos that relate to the concept that I wanted for the page. And for the content I looked things up and wrote things based on that. 
  The way that I communicated with with my devs was mainly in person and email. There was some issues because I was sick and wasn't able to talk to them. 
  And as for the website, it was good. I like how he was able to take my wireframe and do it. Mainly the thing that I would do differently next time is to get numbers rather
  than email cause I feel like that would be a easier way to communicate</p>

<h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>

<p>So for my lead dev role I mostly tried talking to my team in class and if they had any questions they would email me. And that was pretty much the same thing that I did when
  it came to talking to my client. The way I published the website was through github and I sent the url for it to the client through email. And as for managing Github. It was pretty
  easy. It took a little bit because it was something new but I got the hang of it.</p>

<h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>

<p>This one was the hardest to have good communciation. The first wasn't too bad. I was able to clear up things in class and through emails but for the other one the lead dev was on 
  vacation so he didn't really talk to me. I knew what I was doing for one of the websites but for the other one no because the lead dev didn't talk to me. And because of that I was 
  able to finish one of the pages for one of the website. And for the most part I didn't really have any issues when it came to Github.</p>

<h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>

<p>I think that the thing that was the hardest for me was the communication and collaboration parts of this project. The reason being was that fact that I was sick for a bit of this
  and that made it difficult to talk to everyone. But I was able to overcome that after getting better. From this project the thing that I enjoyed the most was when I finished the website 
  and my parts. It made me feel accomplished after doing it. The thing that I wished I did at would be communicating with my teammates. I felt like I sometimes left them in the dark. 
  And becasue of this project I felt like I was more prepared to do this kind of thing in real life. The reason why is because it showed me that I could take something that someone
  wants and make it real.</p>
